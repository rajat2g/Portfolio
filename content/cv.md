experience:
  - role: Technical Advisor - Geotechnical and Tunneling
    organization: "HNTB Corp. "
    years: 2024 - Present
    details: At HNTB, I contributed to major urban tunneling projects such as the
      West Seattle Ballard Link Extension in Seattle and the Eastside Phase 2
      Extension in Los Angeles. My experience includes performing advanced
      engineering and finite element analyses to assess tunnel impacts on
      critical infrastructure, evaluating station stability, and developing
      support of excavation designs. I also reviewed and interpreted
      geotechnical and hydrogeological data to inform design decisions, ensuring
      safe, efficient construction. My work involved analyzing risks to nearly
      800 infrastructure facilities and optimizing design solutions to minimize
      costs and urban impacts, supporting the enhancement of regional transit
      systems.
  - role: Senior Tunneling Engineer
    organization: Arup US Inc.
    years: 2021-2024
    details: At Arup, I expanded my expertise by leading design and digital
      innovation for landmark projects like the BART to Silicon Valley
      extension—the world’s largest metro tunnel by diameter—alongside the
      Silicon Valley Clean Water pipeline, Scarborough Subway Extension in
      Ontario, and major works across California, the UK, and New Zealand. My
      roles encompassed probabilistic modeling, ML-driven tools for risk
      management, and developing GIS/digital twin frameworks to streamline
      design, construction, and asset management. I interfaced with stakeholders
      from public agencies to contractors, delivering award-winning solutions
      that enhance mobility, sustainability, and urban resilience while
      advancing best practices in tunneling and geotechnical engineering.
  - role: Geotechnical and Tunneling Engineer
    organization: AECOM India Pvt. Ltd.
    years: 2015-2017
    details: At AECOM, I contributed to Mumbai Metro Line 3, a 21-mile underground
      corridor aimed at transforming urban mobility across Mumbai. My role
      centered on reviewing SOE designs for stations and shafts, conducting
      damage assessments for buildings in densely populated areas, and devising
      risk mitigation for heritage and critical structures. I developed
      geotechnical site investigations, interpreted subsurface data, created
      geological profiles, and performed advanced numerical modeling to assess
      tunnel impacts and optimize ground improvement strategies. My work ensured
      structural safety, minimized urban disruption, and enabled close
      coordination with public agencies to advance one of India’s most complex
      metro projects.
  - role: Geotechnical Engineer
    organization: CH2M
    years: 2013-2015
    details: At CH2M, I delivered geotechnical design expertise for major highway
      infrastructure projects across Iowa, including the US-20 corridor, Council
      Bluffs interchange, and the IA-100 extension. I led and supervised site
      investigation campaigns, managed laboratory testing programs, and
      developed comprehensive geotechnical interpretive and engineering reports.
      My responsibilities included earthwork quantity estimation, optimizing
      highway upgrades in close coordination with transportation engineers, and
      ensuring safety and efficiency in highway widening, lane additions, and
      intersection improvements. My contributions supported enhanced regional
      connectivity, traffic decongestion, and improved commuter safety for
      critical state-funded transportation projects.
  - role: Industry Academic Collaborated Projects
    details: >-
      In collaboration with industry partners, my work with the research group
      at Colorado School of Mines advanced both technological innovation and the
      state-of-practice in tunneling and underground infrastructure. Building on
      US DOT and federal agency-funded projects such as the Northgate Link
      Extension (Seattle), NEBT and Anacostia River Tunnel (Washington, D.C.),
      Los Angeles Outfall Tunnel, and DARPA’s Underminer Rapid Tunneling
      Project, I developed robust frameworks for risk quantification, spatial
      ground uncertainty, and advanced visualization techniques to guide
      stakeholders in complex, high-risk environments. My responsibilities
      included 3D interpretation of ground conditions, developing tunnel risk
      maps, and creating integrated, data-driven workflows—from automating
      geotechnical data flow to machine learning models that predict TBM
      performance and cutter tool wear.


      Through back-analysis of real-time construction and TBM operational data, I helped validate design assumptions and inform construction decision-making, ensuring proactive risk mitigation. My digital innovation work encompassed developing methodologies for integrating geostatistical predictions and geotechnical risk visualization into project planning, and designing site investigation strategies optimized for uncertainty and value. This collaboration not only delivered cutting-edge technical solutions to major infrastructure challenges, but also fostered vital knowledge transfer between academia and the tunneling industry, accelerating the application of research to real-world engineering practice.
