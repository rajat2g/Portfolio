headline: Rajat's Portfolio
description: "I am a geotechnical and tunneling engineer with national and
  international design and construction support experience for tunnels and
  complex underground structures. I have served as the geotechnical and
  tunneling engineer on numerous projects and have performed engineering
  analyses for the design of tunnel segmental linings, analysis of shaft
  excavations and cut-and-cover structures TBM operation and face pressures,
  soil-structure interaction analysis and construction impact assessment on
  structures due to tunneling. I am proficient in designing automated
  engineering workflows and methodologies for optimizing tunnel construction
  efficiency and is adept at developing intelligent digital tools and software
  for tunnel risk management, geotechnical parameter uncertainty modeling, and
  investigating impacts of TBM ground interaction. Previously, I have served as
  the Chair of the Underground Construction Association (UCA) Young Members’
  committee and was awarded the 2024 UCA Young Tunneler Award at the North
  American Tunneling Conference in Nashville. I am actively involved in
  co-authoring the chapters for recommendations on face support pressures in
  mechanized tunneling and tunneling induced ground deformation with the
  International Tunneling Association (ITA) working groups. "
